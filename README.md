### Hello, world!

I'm Robbie - a software engineer based in London, UK.

My current focus is in backend development - predominantly using Python. Recently, I've been drawn to Rust and am keen to explore more applications of this exciting language.

I'm also a proficient frontend developer, creating projects of all sizes using {Java,Type}Script, React and Node.js.
