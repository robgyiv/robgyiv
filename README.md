### Hello, world!

I'm Robbie, a software engineer based in London, UK.

For the last few years I've been specialising in frontend development - mostly using JavaScript, React and Node.js.

I'm now working more full stack professionally and have been building with Kubernetes, Scala, and Python.

The web3 bug has bit me and there might not be any going back. I've been having fun learning about Solidity, Solana programs and dApps and keen to keep exploring what's possible - exciting times are ahead for us all.
